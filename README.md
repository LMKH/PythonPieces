# Try Except: Apples

I made this programme when first learning Try Except. Try Except lets me as the programmer try out the code for errors. Try, lets me do the test. Except, lets me handle any errors that may come up in my own way instead of a generic fail message.

Exception handling here allows me to write a error message. As you can see if the user inputs the number 0, it will ask the user to try again as you can not divide a number by 0.

In this code the programme asks "how many ways do you want to divide apples?". It then (if the value inputted is not 0) takes the inputted number and divides it by 10.
